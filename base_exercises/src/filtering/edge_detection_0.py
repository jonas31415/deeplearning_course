# The original python file can be reloaded by typing %load src/filtering/edge_detection_0.py in the first line of this cell.
# After successfully solving this exercise, type the following command in the first line of this cell:
# %%writefile src/filtering/edge_detection.py
# This will save the result to a python file, which you will need for the next exercises.
